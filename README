# Skate

This is a personal project that's been in the works for some time.  Originally, the project was written in Rails 3.0, but included a lot of bad code, from which I've since learned.  The old project is still accessible in the aptly named 'rails3oh' branch.

### Progress

I've starting off by testing and creating the basic models necessary for the project.  I'm close to beginning to start adding acceptance tests to help drive the development of the user interface.  I don't have all the time in the world to work on this project, but it's nice when I do.

### Up Next
* Finish up model tests for Team Requests relationship
* Set up acceptance testing
    * Acceptance testing for guests and their limited access
    * Acceptance testing for basic member features
    * Acceptance testing for basic admin features
* The good stuff
    * Rinse, Repeat
