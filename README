There are alot of features that are broken in this branch from when I switched from MySQL to Postgres.  

I'm currently working on rewriting the application from scrap in in Rails 3.1, which you can view in the aptly named rails3one branch.

The code in the new branch is much cleaner, but only includes models and model specs so far.  I want to get this part of the app done and designed before I do anything with the interface.

Right now, the master branch migrates, seeds and runs fine, but there are alot of actions that blow up.

Definitely check out /rinks/locate
